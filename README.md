Good work!

I've added some tests to a new test file. I've also added a new object, GameBoard, to main.py.

For today / tomorrow:

1. Study the code and learn about parts of it that might not be familiar to you. Feel free to ask if you have any questions.
1. Implement `is_goal` in GameBoard so that the tests in main.py pass.
1. Study the tests in main.py: they are intended as examples of how to think about testing code.

Right now I'm imagining a game where the user has to move a turtle through a grid and reach a goal. Let me know if there are specific features you want the game to have!
